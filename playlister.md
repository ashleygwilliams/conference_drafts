## Abstract
everytime i go to teach beginner rubyists rails, it seems that they immediately forget the ruby they've been successfully building command line apps with.

demystifying web development with ruby

web development is just fancy string concatentation: from ruby to rack to sinatra to rails

conventions and patterns -- under the hood


 

During this talk, we will follow the journey of a playlister application from it's origins as a command line application, through it's genesis from static site, to dynamic rack, then sinatra, and then finally rails application. along the way, we will refactor our models to keep them stack agnostic, and in doing so we will reinforce the conventions and patterns that are the hallmark of pure object design.

These resulting interface independent models are better models: they are more flexible, maintainable, and testable. 

Everytime I teach beginner rubyists to develop in Rails, it seems they experience a unique, sudden amnesia: they immediately forget all the ruby they know; it is difficult to  And while there are many resources that aim to decouple the understanding of ruby applications from the Rails framework, very few are targeted at or even mildly appropriate for beginners.

This process is generative, 

punch line: discovered through teaching


WHAT
- from static sites to dynamic rack apps to sinatra to mount that sinatra app in rails
- Decouples understanding of ruby applicaitons from the Rails framework for BEGINNERS
- A web centric ruby curriculum that teaches pure object design in ruby that is stack agnostic
- Teaches model design in an interface independent manner
- databases/ static generated sites/ templating

ASSUMPTIONS
- Interface independent models are better models
- Stack independent architecture is more flexible
- maintainable?
- Service Oriented from the beginning
- modular

WHY
- beginner friendly
- easily testable !!!
- promotes understanding over magic
- faster
- mixins / class macros
